												<h1>About Me.</h1>
											</header>
											<p>Hi, my name is Akshay Sinha. I am from Mississauga, Ontario. My education background is in finance, data analysis, computer programming and film production. I am a motivated, teamwork-oriented data analyst with significant experience creating and streamlining reports and presentations. I am Bilingual, with English and Hindi being my main spoken languages, and I have an intermediate understanding of Urdu and Punjabi.</p>
											<p>
												My college education was in Finance (2016), with my second education being in Film Production (2018). Throughtout my college education, from 2012 to 2016, I was working part time at Scotiabank as a Customer Service Representative. I balanced and funded education by working part time at the bank. Gradually I cemented by place as the team leader and gained more responsiblity in the bank like opening the branch, keeping track and ordering funds and special requests.
											</p>
											<p>
												From 2017 onwards I focused my career towards my creative and passionate side which is film and television. After a year of learing and developing my skills as a filmmaker I decided to enroll into Toronto Film School for a formal education in film production. Upon graduating in December 2018 I immediately started working in the industry in a wide range on jobs that are required on a film set. I have worked on T.V. shows as a PA to Light Techinician, to Camera Assistance to Camera Operator. Whoever after working the industry for 4 years it had become evident that a career in film is not feeible for me long term. So I decided to make another career change towards data analysis.
